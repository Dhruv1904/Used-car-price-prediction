# Used-car-price-prediction
In the following project I would like to predict selling price of used cars. For that I will be using this data set I found on Kaggle of selling price of Used cars in India. I would also like to check which are the factors impacting the selling price of used car


# Methodology

* Explanatory data analysis to discover some trends and pattern by making plots using ggplot2.
* Data cleaning to convert some categorical variables into numerical variables using libraries like dplyr.
* Using correlation matrix and other insights I got from EDA to build multiple regression models.
* Plotting the residuals and interpretting the summary and accuracy to judge the stability of the regression model.
* Finding the best regression model to predict the used car sales price and  also lokking at importance of different features.
